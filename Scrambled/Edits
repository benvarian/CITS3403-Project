1) Becomes a scroll for smaller screen (up/ down)
2) 'Login to compete with friends' could have a border colour
3) Welcome page looks meh
4) Can still do duplicates
5) Three letter rule works now but maybe make wrong word message more general to include duplicates and too short requirements
6) Words could be centred in the ouput (eh) could also do numbers (1. 2. 3.)
7) About you: for admin needs to change words
8) Scrambled gameplay modal could be written better
9) Could have oops modal with different colour
10) The x for oops modal in dark mode is black (same with congrats modal)
11) Idk about the blue in dark mode for game modes in the conograts modal
12) Gridlines for graph in dark mode are black
13) Blue button for dark mode in leaderboard page too
14) Text color needs changing for dark mode register page
15) Sign up worked but when logged in as diff user still have words filled in from when signed in as admin
16) Couldn't test changing letters as admin (didn't know how to access it)
17) After game is finished if you submit a wrong word the modal still pops up (works correctly for word is right, it won't actually submit)
18) Games played/ average is either a lie or the graph doesn't show full game history
